# Hangman

Originally this was a command line project that I used to practice Serialization
If you want to see that project go to commit: 709090c46ac5e40469b36bc83cc26f1646eb3de3

Now it is a web based app that uses sinatra.


* `5desk.txt` is a text file that holds 63000 words. Its functionally a dictionary
for this program

* `app.rb` is where my sinatra routes are held

* `lib/hangman.rb` hold the hangman class

Use `ruby start.rb` to run the project
